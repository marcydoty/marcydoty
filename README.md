### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about programming and technology, with a solid background in the field. I've worked with a range of languages and technologies, including Python, Java for Android, and cloud solutions.

Beyond my tech interests, I'm deeply committed to social causes and helping others in various ways. I believe that making a positive impact goes beyond coding, and contributing to society is an essential part of my work and life.

Feel free to explore my projects, and if you'd like to chat or collaborate, I'm here for that.

See you around!
